What is data science?
Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business.
 It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of 
mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. 
This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened,
 what will happen, and what can be done with the results.
